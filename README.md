## Overview

This repository contains a fine-tuned ClinicalBERT model designed for predicting diseases based on natural language symptom descriptions. Leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this model interprets textual data to provide insights into potential health conditions.

## Features

- **Fine-tuned ClinicalBERT**: Tailored for clinical language understanding.
- **Disease Prediction**: Predicts diseases from symptom descriptions.
- **Interpretable Results**: Uses LIME and SHAP for model explainability.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between symptom descriptions and diseases.
- **Integration with Hugging Face**: Utilizes the Transformers library for model training and inference.

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jazibalii/disease_prediction_using_clinicalbert.git
   cd disease_prediction_using_clinicalbert
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the pre-trained model**:
   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/jazibalii/disease_prediction_using_clinicalbert/releases) section to download the necessary files. Execute the downloaded file to complete the setup.

## Usage

After installation, you can use the model for disease prediction as follows:

1. **Import the necessary libraries**:
   ```python
   from transformers import ClinicalBertTokenizer, ClinicalBertForSequenceClassification
   import torch
   ```

2. **Load the model and tokenizer**:
   ```python
   model = ClinicalBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('path/to/model')
   tokenizer = ClinicalBertTokenizer.from_pretrained('path/to/tokenizer')
   ```

3. **Prepare the input**:
   ```python
   symptoms = "Patient reports fever, cough, and fatigue."
   inputs = tokenizer(symptoms, return_tensors='pt')
   ```

4. **Make predictions**:
   ```python
   with torch.no_grad():
       outputs = model(**inputs)
       predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1)
   ```

5. **Interpret results**:
   Use LIME or SHAP to understand model predictions.

## Model Training

To train the model on your dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your dataset**: Ensure your dataset is in a suitable format (CSV, JSON, etc.) with symptom descriptions and corresponding labels.

2. **Set training parameters**: Adjust hyperparameters in the training script.

3. **Run the training script**:
   ```bash
   python train.py --dataset path/to/dataset.csv
   ```

4. **Save the model**: After training, save the model using:
   ```python
   model.save_pretrained('path/to/save/model')
   ```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics:

1. **Load the test dataset**.
2. **Make predictions** on the test set.
3. **Calculate metrics** like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Example code for evaluation:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Assuming y_true and y_pred are defined
print(classification_report(y_true, y_pred))
```
